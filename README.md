# Angular and Java Decoupled Task List Application

## Overview

The Angular and Java Decoupled Task List Application is a web-based task management system built with Angular on the front end and Java with Spring Boot on the back end. It provides users with a platform to create, update, delete, and track tasks efficiently.

## Features

1. **Task Management:**
   - Users can create tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
   - Tasks can be updated, marked as completed, or deleted as needed.
   - Tasks are organized in a list format for easy viewing and management.

2. **Decoupled Architecture:**
   - The front end is built with Angular, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface.
   - The back end is implemented in Java with Spring Boot, offering a robust and scalable server-side framework.
   - The communication between the front end and back end is achieved through RESTful APIs, ensuring loose coupling and flexibility.

3. **Angular Material Design:**
   - Angular Material is used to enhance the UI with pre-built UI components, such as buttons, cards, and input fields, following the Material Design principles.
   - This provides a consistent and visually appealing user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

4. **Lombok for Boilerplate Reduction:**
   - Lombok library is utilized to reduce boilerplate code in Java, such as getters, setters, and constructors.
   - This results in cleaner and more concise code, improving development productivity and maintainability.

5. **Unit Testing with Jasmine and Karma:**
   - Jasmine and Karma are used for unit testing the Angular components, services, and directives.
   - Unit tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the front-end codebase, enabling seamless refactoring and updates.

## Usage

1. **Task Creation and Management:**
   - Users can navigate through the application to create new tasks, update existing ones, or mark them as completed.
   - Tasks are displayed in a list format with details such as title, description, due date, and priority level.

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
   - Users can access and manage their tasks from desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones with ease.

3. **Integration with Backend API:**
   - The Angular front end communicates with the Java Spring Boot backend via RESTful APIs.
   - The backend handles CRUD operations on tasks, ensuring data integrity and security.
